helllohow are you whatIn the past few days, several cu

complain about a large number of spam and prank calls that
they have been receiving on FaceTime. Whatâ€™s worse is that
they cannot even block these numbers. According to a report
by Ars Technica, this has been on the rise since past few weeks.

number immediately, which makes it annoying. are you doing now
